# python-script
Here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written. I do not consider myself a programmer, I create 
these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem for myself. I would gladly 
accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code. If you would like to make 
any comments then please feel free to email me at 1809112131@qq.com.
